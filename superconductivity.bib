  abstract = {We study the proximity effect between an s-wave superconductor and the surface states of a strong topological insulator. The resulting two-dimensional state resembles a spinless px+ipy superconductor, but does not break time reversal symmetry. This state supports Majorana bound states at vortices. We show that linear junctions between superconductors mediated by the topological insulator form a nonchiral one-dimensional wire for Majorana fermions, and that circuits formed from these junctions provide a method for creating, manipulating, and fusing Majorana bound states.}

  abstract = {Motivated by recent experimental findings, we have developed a theory of the superconducting state for 2D metals without inversion symmetry modeling the geometry of a surface superconducting layer in a field-effect transistor or near the boundary doped by adsorbed ions. In such systems the twofold spin degeneracy is lifted by spin-orbit interaction, and singlet and triplet pairings are mixed in the wave function of the Cooper pairs. As a result, spin magnetic susceptibility becomes anisotropic and Knight shift retains finite and rather high value at T=0.}

  abstract={It was demonstrated within the framework of superconductivity theory that the transition temperature, T_c, of a superconductor with paramagnetic impurities is lower than that of a pure metal.  The dependence of T_c on the impurity concentration was determined. At a certain critical concentration the superconductivity disappeared. The thermodynamic and magnetic properties of superconducting alloys in a concentration range close to the critical value were studied in detail. It was found that for T yields O there is no exponential term in the expression for the heat capacity in this region. The concentration dependence of the energy spectrum gap of such a system was determined. It was found that for a concentration n' approx equal 0.9 n_cr the gap disappears and at large concentrations the system has a continuous spectrum.}
