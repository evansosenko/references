  abstract = {We study the proximity effect between an s-wave superconductor and the surface states of a strong topological insulator. The resulting two-dimensional state resembles a spinless px+ipy superconductor, but does not break time reversal symmetry. This state supports Majorana bound states at vortices. We show that linear junctions between superconductors mediated by the topological insulator form a nonchiral one-dimensional wire for Majorana fermions, and that circuits formed from these junctions provide a method for creating, manipulating, and fusing Majorana bound states.}

  abstract = {Motivated by recent experimental findings, we have developed a theory of the superconducting state for 2D metals without inversion symmetry modeling the geometry of a surface superconducting layer in a field-effect transistor or near the boundary doped by adsorbed ions. In such systems the twofold spin degeneracy is lifted by spin-orbit interaction, and singlet and triplet pairings are mixed in the wave function of the Cooper pairs. As a result, spin magnetic susceptibility becomes anisotropic and Knight shift retains finite and rather high value at T=0.}
