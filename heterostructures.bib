  abstract = {We show that a slightly incommensurate hexagonal substrate (e.g., hexagonal boron nitride) applied to one side of bilayer graphene (BLG) with Bernal stacking inflicts inversion symmetry breaking and opens gaps in the spectrum of minibands created by the periodic moire pattern. This contrasts the behaviour of moire minibands in monolayer graphene, where well-resolved minibands are connected by Dirac points.},
