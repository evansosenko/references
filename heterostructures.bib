  abstract = {We show that a slightly incommensurate hexagonal substrate (e.g., hexagonal boron nitride) applied to one side of bilayer graphene (BLG) with Bernal stacking inflicts inversion symmetry breaking and opens gaps in the spectrum of minibands created by the periodic moire pattern. This contrasts the behaviour of moire minibands in monolayer graphene, where well-resolved minibands are connected by Dirac points.},

@article{1211.4711v2,
  abstract = {Using a general symmetry-based approach, we provide a classification of generic miniband structures for electrons in graphene placed on substrates with the hexagonal Bravais symmetry. In particular, we identify conditions at which the first moir{\'e} miniband is separated from the rest of the spectrum by either one or a group of three isolated mini Dirac points and is not obscured by dispersion surfaces coming from other minibands. In such cases the Hall coefficient exhibits two distinct alternations of its sign as a function of charge carrier density.},
