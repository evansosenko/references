  abstract = {Spin transport experiments in graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms ordered in a honeycomb lattice, indicate spin-relaxation times that are significantly shorter than the theoretical predictions. We investigate experimentally whether these short spin-relaxation times are due to extrinsic factors, such as spin relaxation caused by low impedance contacts, enhanced spin-flip processes at the device edges, or the presence of an aluminum oxide layer on top of graphene in some samples. Lateral spin valve devices using a field-effect transistor geometry allowed for the investigation of the spin relaxation as a function of the charge density, going continuously from metallic hole to electron conduction (charge densities of n∼1012 cm−2) via the Dirac charge neutrality point (n∼0). The results are quantitatively described by a one-dimensional spin-diffusion model where the spin relaxation via the contacts is taken into account. Spin valve experiments for various injector-detector separations and spin precession experiments reveal that the longitudinal (T1) and the transversal (T2) relaxation times are similar. The anisotropy of the spin-relaxation times τ∥ and τ⊥, when the spins are injected parallel or perpendicular to the graphene plane, indicates that the effective spin-orbit fields do not lie exclusively in the two-dimensional graphene plane. Furthermore, the proportionality between the spin-relaxation time and the momentum-relaxation time indicates that the spin-relaxation mechanism is of the Elliott-Yafet type. For carrier mobilities of 2×103--5×103 cm2/V s and for graphene flakes of 0.1--2 μm in width, we found spin-relaxation times on the order of 50--200 ps, times which appear not to be determined by the extrinsic factors mentioned above.},

  abstract = {Spintronics refers commonly to phenomena in which the spin of electrons in a solid state environment plays the determining role. In a more narrow sense spintronics is an emerging research field of electronics: spintronics devices are based on a spin control of electronics, or on an electrical and optical control of spin or magnetism. While metal spintronics has already found its niche in the computer industry - giant magnetoresistance systems are used as hard disk read heads - semiconductor spintronics is yet to demonstrate its full potential. This review presents selected themes of semiconductor spintronics, introducing important concepts in spin transport, spin injection, Silsbee-Johnson spin-charge coupling, and spindependent tunneling, as well as spin relaxation and spin dynamics. The most fundamental spin-dependent interaction in nonmagnetic semiconductors is spin-orbit coupling. Depending on the crystal symmetries of the material, as well as on the structural properties of semiconductor based heterostructures, the spin-orbit coupling takes on different functional forms, giving a nice playground of effective spin-orbit Hamiltonians. The effective Hamiltonians for the most relevant classes of materials and heterostructures are derived here from realistic electronic band structure descriptions. Most semiconductor device systems are still theoretical concepts, waiting for experimental demonstrations. A review of selected proposed, and a few demonstrated devices is presented, with detailed description of two important classes: magnetic resonant tunnel structures and bipolar magnetic diodes and transistors. In view of the importance of ferromagnetic semiconductor materials, a brief discussion of diluted magnetic semiconductors is included. In most cases the presentation is of tutorial style, introducing the essential theoretical formalism at an accessible level, with case-study-like illustrations of actual experimental results, as well as with brief reviews of relevant recent achievements in the field.},

Either adding the spin degree of freedom to conventional charge-based electronic devices or using the spin alone has the potential advantages of nonvolatility, increased data processing speed, decreased electric power consumption, and increased integration densities compared with conventional semiconductor devices. To successfully incorporate spins into existing semiconductor technology, one has to resolve technical issues such as efficient injection, transport, control and manipulation, and detection of spin polarization as well as spin-polarized currents. Recent advances in new materials engineering hold the promise of realizing spintronic devices in the near future. We review the current state of the spin-based devices, efforts in new materials fabrication, issues in spin transport, and optical spin manipulation.},

By taking advantage of atomic scale control provided by MBE, we have investigated submonolayer deposition of adsorbates and their interactions with graphene. Spin transport measurements performed in-situ during systematic introduction of atomic hydrogen demonstrated that hydrogen adsorbed on graphene forms magnetic moments that couple via exchange to the injected spin current. The effects of induced magnetic moments are evident in the non-local magnetoresistance and Hanle spin precession. Exchange coupling between the injected spin current and the induced moments impact the Hanle curves through an effective exchange field leading to new interpretations of Hanle spin precession data and analysis. Here we present a simple procedure in which Hanle curves can be reliably interpreted.},

  abstract = {Current spintronic devices favor Graphene's high carrier mobility, however spin precession measurements using the Hanle effect in nonlocal spin valve devices have yielded spin lifetimes between 100 ps and 1 ns. These are orders of magnitude smaller than what is observed in ESR measurements or expected theoretically. In this talk, I revisit the issue of contact induced losses, and establish the extent to which it accounts for this discrepancy. We use the standard approach of solving the Block equations augmented by boundary conditions characterizing the device.},
