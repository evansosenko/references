  abstract = {In monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), electrons in opposite $K$ valleys are subject to opposite effective Zeeman fields, which are referred to as Ising spin-orbit coupling (SOC) fields. The Ising SOC, originated from in-plane mirror symmetry breaking pins the electron spins in out-of-plane directions, and results in the newly discovered Ising superconducting states with strongly enhanced upper critical fields. In this work, we show that the Ising SOC generates equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs with spin polarization in the in-plane directions. Importantly, the spin-triplet Cooper pairs can induce superconducting pairings in a half-metal wire placed on top of the TMD and result in a topological superconductor with Majorana end states. Direct ways to detect equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs and the differences between Ising superconductors and Rashba superconductors are discussed.}

  abstract = {Molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) has attracted much interest in recent years due to its potential applications in a new generation of electronic devices. Recently, it was shown that thin films of MoS2 can become superconducting with a highest Tc of 10 K when the material is heavily gated to the conducting regime. In this work, using the group theoretical approach, we determine the possible pairing symmetries of heavily gated MoS2. Depending on the electron-electron interactions and Rashba spin-orbit coupling, the material can support an exotic spin-singlet p+ip-wavelike, an exotic spin-triplet s-wavelike, and a conventional spin-triplet p-wave pairing phase. Importantly, the exotic spin-singlet p+ip-wave phase is a topological superconducting phase that breaks time-reversal symmetry spontaneously and possesses nonzero Chern numbers where the Chern number determines the number of branches of chiral Majorana edge states.}

  abstract = {We present a three-band tight-binding (TB) model for describing the low-energy physics in monolayers of group-VIB transition metal dichalcogenides MX2 (M=Mo, W; X=S, Se, Te). As the conduction- and valence-band edges are predominantly contributed by the dz2, dxy, and dx2−y2 orbitals of M atoms, the TB model is constructed using these three orbitals based on the symmetries of the monolayers. Parameters of the TB model are fitted from the first-principles energy bands for all MX2 monolayers. The TB model involving only the nearest-neighbor M-M hoppings is sufficient to capture the band-edge properties in the ±K valleys, including the energy dispersions as well as the Berry curvatures. The TB model involving up to the third-nearest-neighbor M-M hoppings can well reproduce the energy bands in the entire Brillouin zone. Spin-orbit coupling in valence bands is well accounted for by including the on-site spin-orbit interactions of M atoms. The conduction band also exhibits a small valley-dependent spin splitting which has an overall sign difference between MoX2 and WX2. We discuss the origins of these corrections to the three-band model. The three-band TB model developed here is efficient to account for low-energy physics in MX2 monolayers, and its simplicity can be particularly useful in the study of many-body physics and physics of edge states.}

  abstract = {We show that inversion symmetry breaking together with spin-orbit coupling leads to coupled spin and valley physics in monolayers of MoS2 and other group-VI dichalcogenides, making possible controls of spin and valley in these 2D materials. The spin-valley coupling at the valence-band edges suppresses spin and valley relaxation, as flip of each index alone is forbidden by the valley-contrasting spin splitting. Valley Hall and spin Hall effects coexist in both electron-doped and hole-doped systems. Optical interband transitions have frequency-dependent polarization selection rules which allow selective photoexcitation of carriers with various combination of valley and spin indices. Photoinduced spin Hall and valley Hall effects can generate long lived spin and valley accumulations on sample boundaries. The physics discussed here provides a route towards the integration of valleytronics and spintronics in multivalley materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking.}

  abstract = {Field effect transistors (FETs) made of thin flake single crystals isolated from layered materials have attracted growing interest since the success of graphene. Here, we report the fabrication of an electric double layer transistor (EDLT, a FET gated by ionic liquids) using a thin flake of MoS2, a member of the transition metal dichalcogenides, an archetypal layered material. The EDLT of the thin flake MoS2 unambiguously displayed ambipolar operation, in contrast to its commonly known bulk property as an n-type semiconductor. High-performance transistor operation characterized by a large “ON” state conductivity in the order of ∼mS and a high on/off ratio >102 was realized for both hole and electron transport. Hall effect measurements revealed mobility of 44 and 86 cm2 V–1 s–1 for electron and hole, respectively. The hole mobility is twice the value of the electron mobility, and the density of accumulated carrier reached 1 × 1014 cm–2, which is 1 order of magnitude larger than conventional FETs with solid dielectrics. The high-density carriers of both holes and electrons can create metallic transport in the MoS2 channel. The present result is not only important for device applications with new functionalities, but the method itself would also act as a protocol to study this class of material for a broader scope of possibilities in accessing their unexplored properties.}

  abstract = {Two-dimensional materials are attractive for use in next-generation nanoelectronic devices because, compared to one-dimensional materials, it is relatively easy to fabricate complex structures from them. The most widely studied two-dimensional material is graphene, both because of its rich physics and its high mobility. However, pristine graphene does not have a bandgap, a property that is essential for many applications, including transistors. Engineering a graphene bandgap increases fabrication complexity and either reduces mobilities to the level of strained silicon films or requires high voltages. Although single layers of MoS2 have a large intrinsic bandgap of 1.8 eV (ref. 16), previously reported mobilities in the 0.5–3 cm2 V−1 s−1 range are too low for practical devices. Here, we use a halfnium oxide gate dielectric to demonstrate a room-temperature single-layer MoS2 mobility of at least 200 cm2 V−1 s−1, similar to that of graphene nanoribbons, and demonstrate transistors with room-temperature current on/off ratios of 1 × 108 and ultralow standby power dissipation. Because monolayer MoS2 has a direct bandgap, it can be used to construct interband tunnel FETs, which offer lower power consumption than classical transistors. Monolayer MoS2 could also complement graphene in applications that require thin transparent semiconductors, such as optoelectronics and energy harvesting.}

  abstract = {The electronic properties of ultrathin crystals of molybdenum disulfide consisting of N=1,2,…,6 S-Mo-S monolayers have been investigated by optical spectroscopy. Through characterization by absorption, photoluminescence, and photoconductivity spectroscopy, we trace the effect of quantum confinement on the material’s electronic structure. With decreasing thickness, the indirect band gap, which lies below the direct gap in the bulk material, shifts upwards in energy by more than 0.6 eV. This leads to a crossover to a direct-gap material in the limit of the single monolayer. Unlike the bulk material, the MoS2 monolayer emits light strongly. The freestanding monolayer exhibits an increase in luminescence quantum efficiency by more than a factor of 104 compared with the bulk material.}

  abstract = {Novel physical phenomena can emerge in low-dimensional nanomaterials. Bulk MoS2, a prototypical metal dichalcogenide, is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with negligible photoluminescence. When the MoS2 crystal is thinned to monolayer, however, a strong photoluminescence emerges, indicating an indirect to direct bandgap transition in this d-electron system. This observation shows that quantum confinement in layered d-electron materials like MoS2 provides new opportunities for engineering the electronic structure of matter at the nanoscale.}

  abstract = {In this work the complete valence-band structure of the molybdenum dichalcogenides MoS2, MoSe2, and α−MoTe2 is presented and discussed in comparison. The valence bands have been studied using both angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) with synchrotron radiation, as well as ab initio band-structure calculations. The ARPES measurements have been carried out in the constant-final-state (CFS) mode. The results of the calculations show in general very good agreement with the experimentally determined valence-band structures allowing for a clear identification of the observed features. The dispersion of the valence bands as a function of the perpendicular component k⊥ of the wave vector reveals a decreasing three-dimensional character from MoS2 to α−MoTe2 which is attributed to an increasing interlayer distance in the three compounds. The effect of this k⊥ dispersion on the determination of the exact dispersion of the individual states as a function of k‖ is discussed. By performing ARPES in the CFS mode the k‖ component for off-normal emission spectra can be determined. The corresponding k⊥ value is obtained from the symmetry of the spectra along the ΓA, KH, and ML lines, respectively.}

The semiempirical tight binding method is applied to the calculation of the electronic band structures of MoS2, MoSe2, alpha -MoTe2, WS2 and WSe2 in a two dimensional approximation. After a review of the structure and the physical properties of these compounds, the symmetry of the relevant Brillouin zones, including the effects of spin, is discussed. With this material one can fit the calculated band structures of all five compounds to the experimental data. Some of the fine structure of the optical spectra can be interpreted by extending the work into three dimensions. It is also possible to explain some of the properties to which the calculations were not fitted explicitly.}
