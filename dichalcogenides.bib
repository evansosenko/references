  abstract = {In monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), electrons in opposite $K$ valleys are subject to opposite effective Zeeman fields, which are referred to as Ising spin-orbit coupling (SOC) fields. The Ising SOC, originated from in-plane mirror symmetry breaking pins the electron spins in out-of-plane directions, and results in the newly discovered Ising superconducting states with strongly enhanced upper critical fields. In this work, we show that the Ising SOC generates equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs with spin polarization in the in-plane directions. Importantly, the spin-triplet Cooper pairs can induce superconducting pairings in a half-metal wire placed on top of the TMD and result in a topological superconductor with Majorana end states. Direct ways to detect equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs and the differences between Ising superconductors and Rashba superconductors are discussed.}

  abstract = {For pt. II see ibid., vol. 5, 746 (1972). The semiempirical tight binding method is applied to the calculation of the electronic band structures of ${\mathrm{MoS}}_{2}$, ${\mathrm{MoSe}}_{2}$, alpha-${\mathrm{MoTe}}_{2}$, ${\mathrm{WS}}_{2}$ and ${\mathrm{WSe}}_{2}$ in a two dimensional approximation. After a review of the structure and the physical properties of these compounds, the symmetry of the relevant Brillouin zones, including the effects of spin, is discussed. With this material one can fit the calculated band structures of all five compounds to the experimental data. Some of the fine structure of the optical spectra can be interpreted by extending the work into three dimensions. It is also possible to explain some of the properties to which the calculations were not fitted explicitly.}
