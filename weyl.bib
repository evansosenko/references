  abstract = {Time-reversal breaking topological superconductors are new states of matter which can support Majorana zero modes at the edge. In this paper, we propose a new realization of one-dimensional topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes. The proposed system consists of a monolayer of transition metal dichalcogenides MX2 (M=Mo, W; X=S, Se) on top of a superconducting substrate. Based on first-principles calculations, we show that a zigzag edge of the monolayer MX2 terminated by metal atom M has edge states with strong spin-orbit coupling and spontaneous magnetization. By proximity coupling with a superconducting substrate, topological superconductivity can be induced at such an edge. We propose NbS2 as a natural choice of substrate, and estimate the proximity induced superconducting gap based on first-principles calculation and low energy effective model. As an experimental consequence of our theory, we predict that Majorana zero modes can be detected at the 120 degree corner of a MX2 flake in proximity with a superconducting substrate.},

  abstract = {Majorana fermions, quantum particles with non-Abelian exchange statistics, are not only of fundamental importance, but also building blocks for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Although certain experimental breakthroughs for observing Majorana fermions have been made recently, their conclusive dection is still challenging due to the lack of proper material properties of the underlined experimental systems. Here we propose a new platform for Majorana fermions based on edge states of certain non-topological two-dimensional semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling, such as monolayer group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD). Using first-principles calculations and tight-binding modeling, we show that zigzag edges of monolayer TMD can host well isolated single edge band with strong spin-orbit coupling energy. Combining with proximity induced s-wave superconductivity and in-plane magnetic fields, the zigzag edge supports robust topological Majorana bound states at the edge ends, although the two-dimensional bulk itself is non-topological. Our findings points to a controllable and integrable platform for searching and manipulating Majorana fermions.},

@article{1305.7233v1,
  abstract = {Unconventional superconducting states of matter are realized in the presence of strong spin orbit coupling. In particular, non degenerate bands can support odd parity superconductivity with rich topological content. Here we study whether this is the case for Weyl semimetals. These are systems whose low energy sector, in the absence of interactions, is described by linearly dispersing chiral fermions in three dimensions. The energy spectrum has nodes at an even number of points in the Brillouin zone. Consequently both intranodal finite momentum pairing and internodal BCS superconductivity are allowed. For local attractive interaction the finite momentum pairing state with chiral p-wave symmetry is found to be most favorable at finite chemical potential. The state is an analog of the superfluid $^{3}$He A phase, with cooper pairs having finite center of mass momentum. For chemical potential at the node the state is preempted by a fully gapped charge density wave. For long range attraction the BCS state wins out for all values of the chemical potential.},
